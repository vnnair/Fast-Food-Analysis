# Fast-Food-Analysis

This repository is dedicated to a project I worked on as part of a Medium article. 

In this analysis, I use menus from McDonalds and Taco Bell and simulate customer meal consumption. Based on averaging and significance testing, I reach conclusions regarding which restaurant is the healthier option in the long-run
